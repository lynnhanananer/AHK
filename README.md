# AutoHotKey Project Repository

Hello and welcome to my **AutoHotKey** project repository!

This repository contains a collection of my personal projects that I have created using the **AutoHotKey** scripting language. **AutoHotKey** is a powerful tool that allows you to automate repetitive tasks, remap keyboard keys, create macros, and much more.

Each project in this repository has its own folder and is well-documented with comments explaining how the code works. Feel free to browse through the projects and use them as inspiration for your own projects.

If you're looking for pre-compiled executables, you can check out the [releases page](https://github.com/lynnhanananer/AHK/releases/) to download them.

To contribue, you'll need to have **AutoHotKey v1.1** installed on your computer. You can download v1.1 for free from the [official AutoHotKey website](https://www.autohotkey.com/download/).

Please make sure you're using AutoHotkey v1.1 to avoid any compatibility issues with these projects.

If you have any questions, comments, or suggestions for improvement, please don't hesitate to open an issue or pull request. I'm always looking for ways to improve my code and make it more useful for others.

Thank you for visiting my repository, and happy scripting!
